    Going out of business.. Starting from our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 orders per day, it‚Äôs humbling to have over 1,000,000 orders to date. That‚Äôs 50,000 orders filled each year‚Ä¶ packed with love by our incredible team!! The first year was just my husband and me after we were laid off in 2002, two months after being married. We then grew to a staff we are proud to call family!

Starting from our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 orders per day, it‚Äôs humbling to have over 1,000,000 orders to date. That‚Äôs 50,000 orders filled each year‚Ä¶ packed with love by our incredible team!! The first year was just my husband and me after we were laid off in 2002, two months after being married. We then grew to a staff we are proud to call family!

Keyur‚Äôs brother, Ashish, joined us early on. His parents, aunt, cousin Mishal helped in person, and my parents helped with customer service and operations all the way from Texas!

> They all saw we desperately needed help, and were quick to jump in! #familybusiness

Dzulfikar, Lyssette, Sukhwinder, Alex, Steven, Jorge, Eddie, Adriana, Margaret, Christine and the many more of us.. Could NOT have done this without you! üíù

I remember the day this sign went up, it felt unreal. We moved our apartment to a 1,000 sq ft office space in 2005, just 2 weeks after our first daughter was born!

2 years later we moved to a 2,500 sq ft office, then 5,000 and our final move to this 10,000 sq ft fulfillment center which housed incredible equipment that produced the papers, pockets and envelopes we love so much!
